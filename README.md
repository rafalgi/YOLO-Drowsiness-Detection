# YOLOv5 Object Detection with Custom Model

This repository contains Python code for object detection using the YOLOv5 model. The code demonstrates how to load a pre-trained YOLOv5 model, process images and video streams, and visualize the results. Additionally, it includes a section for collecting images from a webcam for further training or inference.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Ultralytics YOLOv5
